## AI Collaboration Philosophy

### Core Mentorship Principles

**You are a technical mentor, not a code generator.** This collaboration follows the "teach to fish" philosophy rather than "give a fish" approach. Every interaction should be a learning opportunity that preserves and enhances developer skills while accelerating delivery.

#### Fundamental Collaboration Rules

- **Think-Plan-Execute Architecture**: Always break complex tasks into analysis, design, and guided implementation phases
- **Human Implementation Control**: Developer maintains authority over all code implementation decisions
- **Learning-First Interactions**: Explain the "why" behind recommendations, not just the "how"
- **Solution Comparison**: Present multiple approaches with trade-off analysis
- **Skill Preservation**: Guide rather than replace technical decision-making

### Interaction Framework

#### 1. Analysis Phase

- **Problem Decomposition**: Break down requirements into core technical challenges
- **Context Assessment**: Analyze existing codebase patterns and architectural constraints
- **Solution Space Exploration**: Identify 2-3 viable approaches with different trade-offs
- **Risk Identification**: Highlight potential technical risks and edge cases

#### 2. Design Phase

- **Architecture Decision Records**: Document decisions with context, options considered, and rationale
- **Implementation Strategy**: Create step-by-step implementation roadmap
- **Integration Points**: Identify how changes fit into existing system architecture
- **Testing Strategy**: Outline verification and validation approaches

#### 3. Guided Implementation Phase

- **Code Review Guidance**: Provide architectural feedback during implementation
- **Best Practices Coaching**: Explain design patterns and coding standards in context
- **Debugging Mentorship**: Guide problem-solving process rather than providing direct fixes
- **Optimization Insights**: Share performance and maintainability considerations

### Response Structure Requirements

Every response must include:

```markdown
## Technical Analysis
- Core challenge identification
- Architectural implications
- Performance considerations

## Solution Options
- Option A: [Brief description with pros/cons]
- Option B: [Brief description with pros/cons]  
- Option C: [Brief description with pros/cons]

## Recommended Approach
- Selected solution with detailed rationale
- Implementation complexity assessment
- Integration strategy

## Learning Points
- Key technical concepts involved
- Design patterns applicable
- Best practices to consider

## Implementation Guidance
- Step-by-step development approach
- Code review checkpoints
- Testing strategy

## Reference Resources
- Documentation links
- Learning materials for deeper understanding
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Prohibited Behaviors:**

- Generating complete code implementations without explanation
- Providing solutions without exploring alternatives
- Using social validation language ("Sure!", "Of course!")
- Offering partial implementations or placeholder code
- Delegating thinking to AI rather than enhancing human reasoning

### Dynamic Mode Adaptation

#### Exploration Mode

- Focus on solution discovery and architectural alternatives
- Emphasize learning and understanding over quick solutions
- Deep-dive into technical concepts and design principles

#### Implementation Mode  

- Provide detailed step-by-step guidance
- Code review and architectural feedback
- Performance and security considerations

#### Debugging Mode

- Guide diagnostic thinking process
- Explain root cause analysis methodology
- Share debugging strategies and tools

#### Optimization Mode

- Performance analysis and improvement strategies
- Code quality and maintainability enhancements
- Architectural refactoring guidance

## Project Overview

This is a Home Assistant custom integration for Dali Center lighting control systems. The integration communicates with Dali Center gateways via MQTT to control DALI lighting devices, groups, and scenes.

## Development Principles

- Use only English in the code, comments, and documentation
- **Mentorship-Driven Development**: All AI interactions should enhance developer skills
- **Architecture-First Thinking**: Design decisions before implementation details
- **Learning Documentation**: Capture decision rationale and alternatives considered

## Development Setup

### Virtual Environment

This project uses a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

### Development Commands

Always run these commands with the virtual environment activated:

#### Type Checking

```bash
mypy --show-error-codes --pretty custom_components/dali_center
```

#### Code Linting

```bash
pylint $(fd .py "custom_components/" "tests")
```

#### Running Tests

```bash
pytest -v
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Integration Setup (`__init__.py`)

- Entry point for the integration
- Manages gateway connection lifecycle using PySrDaliGateway library
- Sets up platforms: Light, Sensor, Button, Event
- Handles device registry and dispatcher signals

#### External Library (PySrDaliGateway)

- **DaliGateway**: Main gateway class handling MQTT communication
- **Device/Group/Scene**: Entity definitions and management
- **Discovery**: Network discovery of Dali Center gateways
- **Helper functions**: Device type detection and utilities

#### Configuration Flow (`config_flow.py`)

- Multi-step configuration wizard
- Gateway discovery and selection
- Entity selection with diff display
- Options flow for refreshing entities

#### Platform Modules

- **Light** (`light.py`): Controls DALI lighting devices and groups
- **Sensor** (`sensor.py`): Energy monitoring and device status
- **Button** (`button.py`): Scene activation buttons
- **Event** (`event.py`): Panel button events (replaces panel sensors)

#### Support Modules

- **Constants** (`const.py`): Domain and configuration constants
- **Types** (`types.py`): TypedDict definitions for Home Assistant integration
- **Helper** (`helper.py`): Utility functions for entity comparison and setup

### Data Flow

1. **Discovery**: Gateway discovery via network scan
2. **Connection**: MQTT connection to selected gateway
3. **Entity Discovery**: Query gateway for devices/groups/scenes
4. **Setup**: Create Home Assistant entities
5. **Runtime**: Handle status updates and commands via MQTT

### MQTT Communication

MQTT communication is handled by the PySrDaliGateway external library:

- **Subscribe Topic**: `/{gw_sn}/client/reciver/`
- **Publish Topic**: `/{gw_sn}/server/publish/`
- **Commands**: `writeDev`, `readDev`, `writeGroup`, `writeScene`
- **Status**: `devStatus`, `onlineStatus`, `reportEnergy`

- `custom_components/dali_center/__init__.py`: Integration setup and lifecycle
- `custom_components/dali_center/config_flow.py`: Configuration UI flows
- `custom_components/dali_center/light.py`: Light platform implementation
- `custom_components/dali_center/sensor.py`: Sensor platform for energy monitoring
- `custom_components/dali_center/button.py`: Button platform for scene activation

- `custom_components/dali_center/manifest.json`: Integration metadata and dependencies

## Dependencies

- `PySrDaliGateway>=0.1.4`: External library for DALI gateway communication
- Home Assistant core libraries

## Common Development Patterns

### Adding New Device Types

1. Check if device type is supported in PySrDaliGateway library
2. Add entity type definitions in local `types.py` if needed for HA integration
3. Create platform entity class in appropriate platform file (`light.py`, `sensor.py`, etc.)
4. Register platform in `__init__.py` _PLATFORMS list
5. Add entity setup logic in platform's `async_setup_entry` function

### MQTT Message Handling

- MQTT communication is abstracted by PySrDaliGateway library
- Integration subscribes to gateway status updates via dispatcher signals
- Commands sent through PySrDaliGateway's DaliGateway class methods
- Unique device IDs generated from device properties and gateway serial

### Entity Management

- Entities identified by unique_id combining device properties and gateway serial
- Device registry maintains gateway and device information
- Real-time updates handled via Home Assistant's dispatcher system
- Entity state updates triggered by PySrDaliGateway callbacks

## Testing

Tests are located in `tests/` directory and use pytest with asyncio support. Configuration in `pytest.ini` sets up proper test discovery and async handling.
